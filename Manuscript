\begin{abstract}

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a common and increasingly serious disease. This article provides a comprehensive review of the impact of diet on CKD, integrating the latest research. Extensive literature demonstrates that dietary choices play a critical role in the emergence, development, and control of CKD. This article discusses key dietary factors such as protein, carbohydrate intake, and management of sodium, phosphorus, and potassium in the context of CKD prevention and treatment. Additionally, the impact of carbonated beverages on CKD, dietary patterns such as the Dietary Approaches to Prevent Hypertension (DASH) and the importance of the Mediterranean diet were examined.Although some studies in the literature are limited by region and small sample size, the importance of these summaries cannot be completely denied. Maintaining a healthy and appropriate diet can better protect our kidneys.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}


Chronic Kidney Disease is a global health burden that increases the risk of premature death or reduced quality of life. However, Chronic Kidney Disease does not present with obvious symptoms until the later stages of the disease.Therefore,it is easy to ignore Chronic Kidney Disease until it becomes end stage renal disease, which requires dialysis or kidney transplant for whole life. We need to know how to protect our kidneys in our daily lives and how to slow down the progression of chronic kidney disease.The purpose of this narrative is to describe how diet affects the progression of CKD, such as nutrient control and beverage control. The article selected a variety of detection methods including observational studies, randomized controlled trials (RCT), and multivariable Cox proportional hazards models. The article did not consider the impact of other factors on CKD, such as obesity, sleep quality and genes.

\section{Methods}
\label{sec:meth}

\ \ \ The role of diet in Chronic Kidney disease progression has been of interest for many years. There are many data studies trying to find a relationship between diet and Chronic kidney disease.In a Singaporean Chinese study, data demonstrated that restricting protein sources is likely to delay the progression of Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) to ESRD. ESRD is the final stage of CKD and is defined by the need for renal replacement therapy (dialysis or transplantation). This study use a randomized controlled trial and concluded that Red meat intake is strongly associated with ESRD risk in a dose-dependent manner (hazard ratio for highest quartile versus lowest quartile,1.40 [95\% CI, 1.15 to 1.71; Ptrend<0.001] ). Intake of poultry, fish, eggs, or dairy products did not associate with risk of ESRD. Then in substitution analysis, replacing one serving of red meat with other food sources of protein associated with a maximum relative risk reduction of 62.4\% ( 95\% CI, 33.1 to 78.9; P<0.01)\cite{lew2017red}.On the other hand, limiting protein intake can also slow the progression of chronic kidney disease.The researchers conducted randomized controlled trials with 690 patients in the low-protein diet (LPD) group and 682 patients in the control group.Moderate to strong evidence indicated that LPD was significantly effective for decreasing the urinary albumin excretion rate (SMD:0.62, 95\%CI:0.06–1.19) and proteinuria (SMD:0.69, 95\%CI:0.22–1.16) versus the control group. No statistical difference, however, was found in glycosylated hemoglobin (SMD:0.17, 95\%CI:-0.18–0.51), serum creatinine (SMD:0.20, 95\%CI:-0.26–0.66), as well as glomerular filtration rate (SMD:0.21, 95\%CI:-0.29–0.71) between the two groups\cite{li2019efficacy}.

Theoretically, limiting protein intake is useful because high protein intake will result in higher H+ with kidney injury manifest by albuminuria,with increased risk for incident CKD and its progression to end-stage renal disease.When dietary H+ increments cease, acid retention in Nx is reversible, as shown by a return to baseline.After cessation of the dietary H+ increment, UNAE for Nx was immediately higher than for sham and then returned to UNAE comparable to sham, resulting in the observed reduction in H+ retention for Nx and sham, with the net reduction in H+ retention for Nx being greater. Data show that urinary NAGase excretion decreases to baseline levels after discontinuation of dietary H+ increments in the form of casein or NH4Cl, suggesting that long-term renal damage in Nx may be avoided by simply discontinuing dietary H+ increments\cite{wesson2017acid}.Because sulfur is oxidized to inorganic sulfates, we need to control sulfur-rich foods such as hard/processed cheeses, egg yolks, meats, poultry, and fish. This means we need to eat more fruits and vegetables,whcih are rich in citrates and malates, which are burned internally to produce bicarbonate. Urinary pH is a simple tool to monitor net endogenous acid production, this study used a 24-hour urine collection to measure steady-state net acid excretion\cite{scialla2013dietary}.However, this study did not include statistics on sodium and potassium intake because multiple 24-hour urine collections would be too cumbersome.

\end{equation}

24-h urinecollection, Makes no assumptions about composition of foods, nutrient absorption, and sulfur content of proteins\cite{scialla2013dietary}.

The study compared the dietary acid load of three diets. The results confirmed that increasing fruit and vegetable intake reduced net acid excretion by approximately one-third and was comparable to taking 0.5 mEq/kg/kg sodium bicarbonate per day. This means that replacing the nutrient-poor, energy-dense foods common in contemporary diets with greater fruit and vegetable intake can significantly reduce net endogenous acid production without the need for undue protein restriction\cite{scialla2013dietary}.

On the other hand, it is also important whether the drinks people drink on a daily basis are harmful to the kidneys. For example, carbonated drinks and sugar-free drinks are now popular.As we mentioned before, eating more fruits and vegetables consumes phosphate. Long-term excessive intake of phosphate can lead to hyperphosphatemia, which is an important factor in determining morbidity and mortality in patients with chronic kidney disease.However, in a random survey of dialysis centers in Hirosaki, Japan, data showed that 93\% of subjects knew that sodas contained high sugar content, while only 25\% knew that phosphates were present in such drinks. 43\% of people drink at least 1 to 5 cans of soda per week.When compared with the fasting survey data, it was found that urinary calcium excretion (adjusted using urinary creatinine) was significantly higher 2 hours after consuming 350 ml of carbonated soda water.This illustrates the need for increased awareness of beverages containing artificially added phosphates.CKD patients need to control the frequency of carbonated drinks and sugar-free drinks\cite{shutto2013inadequate}.Dietary management is an effective way to slow the progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD). However, few studies have investigated the effects of carbohydrate intake in patients with CKD.Ren used multivariable Cox proportional hazards models to study the relationship between carbohydrates and sugars and CDK development.Participants with CKD had a 16\% lower risk of death when consuming 30-45\% of their energy from carbohydrates, and 5-10\% of their energy from sugars reduced their risk by 35\%. Replacing carbohydrate energy intake with protein can reduce the risk by up to 30\%, and replacing sugar with non-sugar carbohydrates can reduce the risk by up to 55\%\cite{ren2023associations}.

\section{Results}
\label{sec:resu}
For patients with pre-CKD, it is important to control protein intake, especially the amount of red meat. At the same time, the management of sodium and acid is also very important. You can increase your own internal consumption by eating more fruits and vegetables. Of course, fluid intake also needs to be paid attention to, and the intake of drinks like soda should be reduced.The most frequently used of the several studies mentioned is the randomized controlled trial. I think that using randomized controlled trials is a very correct choice when studying the effects of individual nutrients on CKD patients.RCT minimizes the impact of confounding factors, it accurately demonstrates the actual results through data. At the same time, it can also be proved that there is a causal relationship between low protein, low sodium, and low carbohydrate and slowing down the development of CKD. The double-blind design adopted in the randomized controlled trial also avoids the influence of subjective bias. However, due to the time and sample size requirements of randomized controlled trials, in the study of protein intake among Singaporean Chinese, the literature mentioned that the sample was too small, which would make the results not very convincing. In the study of urine testing, since it required multiple tests of 24-hour urine, the process was too cumbersome and therefore was not successfully implemented.The second one that appears many times is multivariable Cox proportional hazards models. This model can consider multiple potential predictors, allowing for a more comprehensive understanding of how these factors affect CKD. The hazard ratio generated by the model can be used to compare the relative impact of different predictors on the risk of CKD. This makes it possible to determine which factors confer less risk for the development of CKD. Several of the studies I selected provided very detailed data and images so I could quickly and clearly understand the conclusions.

\section{Discussion}
\label{sec:disc}

The article summarizes the impact of individual nutrients, dietary patterns and fluid intake, but does not consider the impact of legal additives in food on CKD and whether genetic food has an impact.
