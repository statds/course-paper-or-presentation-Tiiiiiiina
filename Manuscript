\begin{abstract}

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a common and increasingly serious disease. This article provides a comprehensive review of the impact of diet on CKD, integrating the latest research. Extensive literature demonstrates that dietary choices play a critical role in the emergence, development, and control of CKD. This article discusses key dietary factors such as protein, carbohydrate intake, and management of sodium, phosphorus, and potassium in the context of CKD prevention and treatment. Additionally, the impact of carbonated beverages on CKD, dietary patterns such as the Dietary Approaches to Prevent Hypertension (DASH) and the importance of the Mediterranean diet were examined.Although some studies in the literature are limited by region and small sample size, the importance of these summaries cannot be completely denied. Maintaining a healthy and appropriate diet can better protect our kidneys.
