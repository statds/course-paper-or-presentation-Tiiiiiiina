\begin{abstract}

Achieving true equality in schools necessitates comprehensive and integrated measures by national governments, with a specific focus on the significance of equality in education and the corresponding equitable distribution of resources. However, the uneven allocation of resources, particularly concerning social class, fundamentally shapes variations in students' access to educational opportunities, perpetuating disparities that undermine the core principles of a fair and inclusive education system.In this context, it is imperative to address the systemic challenges that contribute to educational inequities. By implementing targeted interventions that specifically target the root causes of these disparities, policymakers can work towards dismantling barriers that hinder equal access to quality education.Furthermore, a holistic approach should encompass not only the allocation of resources but also initiatives that foster a supportive learning environment. This includes strategies to address socio-economic factors, such as the influence of a father's occupational prestige, which this study identifies as a significant factor impacting a student's likelihood of receiving a diploma\cite{lynch2005equality}. This study sheds light on the nuanced relationship between family social status, gender, and educational achievements, emphasizing the need for targeted interventions to promote a more inclusive and equitable education system.
