\begin{abstract}

Achieving true equality in schools necessitates comprehensive and integrated measures by national governments, with a specific focus on the significance of equality in education and the corresponding equitable distribution of resources. However, the uneven allocation of resources, particularly concerning social class, fundamentally shapes variations in students' access to education\cite{lynch2005equality}.This study delves into the connection between the educational achievements of 11-year-old schoolchildren in Ireland and the social status of their families. Utilizing data from StatLib, originally collected by Greaney and Kelleghan, and subsequently reanalyzed by Raftery and Hout.The study employed logistic regression modeling and resampling methods to evaluate the data, affirming the substantial impact of family social status on students' educational equity. Additionally, the study examined the influence of gender on educational equity. The findings revealed a correlation between the prestige score of a father's occupation and a student's likelihood of receiving a diplomaâ€”higher occupational prestige increases the chances of graduation Upon controlling for the father's occupational reputation score, no gender differences were observed among students who earned a diploma.The paper concludes with an explanation of the limitations of this study and potential future work.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}


Education profoundly influences individuals' perceptions and cognitive abilities, making a child's educational journey crucial for any family as it shapes their worldview. However, with increasing class disparities, educational resources have been significantly impacted. Consequently, it becomes imperative to delve into issues surrounding educational equity.Educational equity strives to rectify the unequal distribution of educational resources, aiming for a balanced educational progress that acknowledges every student's potential given adequate opportunities, time, and resources. This paper will investigate the potential correlation between student graduation rates and family socioeconomic status by analyzing the graduation percentages of 500 students within a school district\cite{0ebfdaaa-1f75-3681-8239-57d0118360bc}.The article's primary objective is to scrutinize whether current educational policies sufficiently address the potential influence of a family's economic situation on student achievement. This exploration seeks to suggestion to governmental interventions, ensuring they are targeted to foster an education system that is not only equitable but also inclusive.

In Raftery's article, he notes a decline in class differences regarding educational attainment on a broad scale. However, he emphasizes that class barriers persist, albeit to a lesser extent, owing to the expansion of the education system, which has resulted in reduced selectivity. Despite the government's proposed educational reforms, Raftery argues that they have failed to make a meaningful impact on equal opportunities in education. Consequently, he advocates for the exploration and implementation of more effective alternatives to address these persistent issues\cite{0ebfdaaa-1f75-3681 -8239-57d0118360bc}.I have similar ideas to him,but I plan to use a logistic regression model to detect the correlation between family social status and educational equity, and then use the resampling method to evaluate the performance of the model.The article will delve into two key issues, aiming to explore the correlation between the prestige scores of fathers' occupations and students' achievement of a diploma. Additionally, it will analyze the relationship between students' diploma attainment and gender, while controlling for the prestige scores of fathers' occupations. The dataset under examination consists of 500 observations and encompasses six variables, namely Sex, DVRT, Educational level attained, Leaving Certificate, Prestige score for father's occupation, and Type of school.
