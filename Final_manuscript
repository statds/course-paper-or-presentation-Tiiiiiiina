Achieving true equality in schools necessitates comprehensive and integrated measures by national governments, with a specific focus on the significance of equality in education and the corresponding equitable distribution of resources. However, the uneven allocation of resources, particularly concerning social class, fundamentally shapes variations in students' access to educational opportunities, perpetuating disparities that undermine the core principles of a fair and inclusive education system.In this context, it is imperative to address the systemic challenges that contribute to educational inequities. By implementing targeted interventions that specifically target the root causes of these disparities, policymakers can work towards dismantling barriers that hinder equal access to quality education.Furthermore, a holistic approach should encompass not only the allocation of resources but also initiatives that foster a supportive learning environment. This includes strategies to address socio-economic factors, such as the influence of a father's occupational prestige, which this study identifies as a significant factor impacting a student's likelihood of receiving a diploma\cite{lynch2005equality}. This study sheds light on the nuanced relationship between family social status, gender, and educational achievements, emphasizing the need for targeted interventions to promote a more inclusive and equitable education system.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}


The escalating class disparities in society have cast a considerable shadow over educational resources, prompting an imperative exploration of issues related to educational equity.Educational equity emerges as a critical concept in addressing the pervasive inequalities in the distribution of educational resources. It aspires to foster a balanced educational progress that recognizes and harnesses the potential of every student, contingent upon the provision of adequate opportunities, time, and resources. In essence, educational equity serves as a guiding principle to rectify the existing imbalances and promote a fair and inclusive educational system that caters to the diverse needs of all learners.As we embark on this exploration of educational equity, it is essential to navigate the intricate interplay between socio-economic factors and academic outcomes. By scrutinizing the relationship between family social status, gender, and educational achievements, we gain valuable insights that can inform targeted interventions aimed at fostering a more equitable and inclusive educational environment.
The multifaceted nature of educational equity underscores the need for a comprehensive understanding of the challenges and opportunities inherent in the education system. This paper will investigate the potential correlation between student graduation rates and family socioeconomic status by analyzing the graduation percentages of 500 students within a school district\cite{0ebfdaaa-1f75-3681-8239-57d0118360bc}.

This study delves into the connection between the educational achievements of 11-year-old schoolchildren in Ireland and the social status of their families. Utilizing data from StatLib, originally collected by Greaney and Kelleghan, and subsequently reanalyzed by Raftery and Hout, the study employed logistic regression modeling and resampling methods to evaluate the data. The results affirmed the substantial impact of family social status on students' educational equity. Additionally, the study examined the influence of gender on educational equity.The findings revealed a significant correlation between the prestige score of a father's occupation and a student's likelihood of receiving a diploma. Higher occupational prestige was associated with increased chances of graduation. Notably, upon controlling for the father's occupational reputation score, no gender differences were observed among students who earned a diploma.
As we navigate through the intricate dynamics of educational equity, it is essential to consider the multifaceted influences that contribute to varying outcomes among students. The article's primary objective is to scrutinize whether current educational policies sufficiently address the potential influence of a family's economic situation on student achievement. This exploration seeks to suggestion to governmental interventions, ensuring they are targeted to foster an education system that is not only equitable but also inclusive.

In Raftery's article, he notes a decline in class differences regarding educational attainment on a broad scale. However, he emphasizes that class barriers persist, albeit to a lesser extent, owing to the expansion of the education system, which has resulted in reduced selectivity. Despite the government's proposed educational reforms, Raftery argues that they have failed to make a meaningful impact on equal opportunities in education. Consequently, he advocates for the exploration and implementation of more effective alternatives to address these persistent issues\cite{0ebfdaaa-1f75-3681-8239-57d0118360bc}.I have similar ideas to him,but I plan to use a logistic regression model to detect the correlation between family social status and educational equity, and then use the resampling method to evaluate the performance of the model.The article will delve into two key issues, aiming to explore the correlation between the prestige scores of fathers' occupations and students' achievement of a diploma. Additionally, it will analyze the relationship between students' diploma attainment and gender, while controlling for the prestige scores of fathers' occupations. The dataset under examination consists of 500 observations and encompasses six variables, namely Sex, DVRT, Educational level attained, Leaving Certificate, Prestige score for father's occupation, and Type of school.

\section{Methods}
\label{sec:meth}
 The decision to employ logistic regression is grounded in the nature of the Prestige score for the father's occupation, which is a continuous variable. This analytical choice allows for a comprehensive exploration of the associations among all variables while effectively mitigating potential confounding effects.By adopting logistic regression, this study aims to unravel the intricate interplay of various factors and their impact on the likelihood of students obtaining a diploma. The continuous nature of the Prestige score necessitates a method that can adeptly handle such variables, making logistic regression a fitting choice for robust analysis.As we delve into the complexities of logistic regression, it becomes evident that this modeling approach provides a sophisticated means of understanding the relationships between variables, shedding light on the nuanced dynamics that influence educational outcomes. This nuanced understanding, in turn, contributes to the broader goal of promoting educational equity and informed decision-making within the educational landscape.In summary, logistic regression emerges as a valuable analytical tool in this study, offering a methodological approach that aligns with the study's objectives and the nature of the variables under scrutiny. Through this lens, we seek to unravel the intricacies of educational outcomes and the factors that shape them, paving the way for more targeted and effective interventions.This approach enables a nuanced understanding of the impact of various factors, including the continuous Prestige score, on the likelihood of the outcome\cite{sperandei2014understanding}.The model looks like this:

\begin{equation}
log(\frac{\pi}{1-\pi})=\beta_{0}+\beta_{1}\times\X_{1}+\beta_{2}\times\X_{2}+\cdots\beta_{m}\times\X_{m}
\end{equation}

where $\pi$ indicates the probability of an event,and $\beta_{i}$ are the regression coefficients associated with the reference group and the explanatory variables. At this point, it is crucial to emphasize an important concept. In this context, I utilized the R programming language to gather and process all the data. Upon importing the data using R, the initial Table~\ref{tab1} and Figure~\ref{fig1} was generated, illustrating the relationship between the father's professional reputation and the student's graduation status.

From the Figure~\ref{fig1}, the p-value significantly falls below 0.05, indicating a strong belief that the reputation score of the father's profession influences the student's likelihood of obtaining a graduation certificate.
